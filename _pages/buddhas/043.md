# Eliminating

## To succeed, let your determination include sensitivity, readiness, and caution; expect the unexpected.



Some resolution is pointing to a breakthrough, but decisive action will be necessary. If you diligently hold your ground, warding off negative tendencies or bad influences, goodness will indeed prevail.

The persistence of negativity is a factor in human affairs: just when you think an undesirable element has been uprooted, it—or another—will pop up again, sprouting through some crack in the pavement of decent society. And these elements need not take extravagant forms, such as those exhibited in violent conflict. Garden-variety lies and deceit are more common and persistent, but should also be rooted out diligently. Be resolute against the forces of negativity—whether in your social or professional life, or in your own soul. But certain rules must be followed for your efforts to succeed.

The first rule: Do not compromise with corruption. Misdeeds and shameful actions must be identified for what they are and quickly discredited. The second: You cannot successfully resist or defeat negativity on its own terms. Positive alternatives, which lead away from the nature of the problem, are more appropriate than trying to counter corruption with raw power. The third: The means used to counter negativity need to be consistent with the result you want to achieve. You cannot stop the spreading of lies by spreading more of them.

By adding to the positive elements in a situation, you automatically diminish the bad. This is the only way to tip the scales and effectively neutralize negativity over time. The reminder here is for you to maintain a consistent level of self-awareness while sharing your advantages and virtue with others.
