# Responding

## The Buddha sits on the side of the stream allowing the motion and sound of the water to wash away attachment.

## Meaning

Great response attracts great gifts and great blessings. A natural responsiveness attracts success through support and perseverance rather than bold action. Thus, a wise person demonstrates strength like a powerful but gentle mare. This auspicious hexagram, consisting of all yin lines, represents the power of the feminine principle, which has not been honored in our modern world; however, such receptivity is much more powerful and healing than we think.

The receptive force is sensual and subtle, and can be overlooked by too much thinking, talking, and planning. When spring comes, does the grass “plan” to grow? This is a time to concentrate on realities rather than potentials—with how to respond to a situation rather than how to direct or manipulate it. The mature feminine allows herself to be guided by a higher power and is skilled at graceful acceptance. Spiritually, her quiet contribution is highly effective, bringing a deeply felt kind of success.

Do not be too assertive at this time. If you try to direct things now, you are liable to become confused or alienated. Opening yourself to receive what you attract should be your primary concern. Be patient, and take your time. Draw strength from mindfulness, and you will be doubly fortunate. Focus more on feeling than on action. Be broad and deep in your attitude so that you accept everything that comes with grace and equanimity. Be receptive and spacious like the ocean; let the river of changes flow to you. You might allow a partner to take the lead for now. Strive for a natural responsiveness that is based on inner strength rather than outer show. You will be able to go further by letting go of control rather than forging ahead under your own steam. Receptive power arises through alignment with creative power, not in opposition to it.
