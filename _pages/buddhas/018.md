# Remedy

## Everyone makes mistakes and most people want to correct them, but only the wise know when to stop trying.



When something is rotting, it is time to repair the damage. In the world of human affairs, self-indulgence and corruption grow like weeds in an untended garden: they must be faced squarely and rooted out through bold action. Eliminating corruption—and the sloppiness that leads to it—is an ennobling human enterprise, as it clears the way for fresh, new beginnings. Such repair efforts ultimately lead to supreme success.

This is a time to be lean and efficient. The weeds must be rooted out before the whole garden is lost. Fighting decay, indifference, and corruption is not a simple matter; the steps must be evaluated carefully, and planning should precede action. Resist the temptation to strike out prematurely. Gather strength around you, and marshal your inner resources—arresting decay requires a strong effort. When you do act, pay close attention to the process. Make your strike as precise and clear as the path of the surgeon’s knife.
