# Dispersing

## Sometimes, in the course of a great work, it is important to let go of any thought of self or any desire for personal reward.

## Meaning

Nothing survives foreverâ€”not even rocks or the most rigid of structures. Likewise, all of our obstacles will dissolve in time too. The erosion of that which has been solid is not a bad thing; in fact, it means that something new is in the process of being created. Picture ice floes, hardened in winter and dispersing in the warmth of spring; when the ice melts, a mighty river emerges. This image points to a situation in which small changes produce big results over time.

Rigidity in the hearts of humans breeds an egocentric separateness, but this can be transformed by a greater force, such as an uplifting ceremony or other communal activity. The thawing of closed hearts always improves conditions for everyone.

Before the heart, the first thing to dissolve is any mental rigidity that might be feeding a sense of separation from others. Try to work closely with your friends and compatriots, concentrating on common activities that emanate from your integrity and goodwill. Some slightly dramatic action in support of the greater good might shift energy, lift spirits, and lead to new possibilities.

Spiritual impulses, including a sense of justice, should be honored and acted upon now. Such impulses provide a gentle push toward important and constructive change. If you avoid righteous indignation or aggressive force of any kind, any sense of disunity can be overcome. If you have lingering business or partnerships that are inactive or not working, this reading suggests that you consider dissolving them.
