# Beginning

## The birth of a new venture or relationship is an entry into the unknown. 



New things seem to be rushing upon you, and confusion can easily take over. However, chaos is a powerful force when you harness it properly, so donâ€™t rush things now. Do not let events overwhelm you. As you take the first step, stay calm and ready to persevere. Ask for guidance and support.

Challenges lie ahead, but they are challenges you can handle. Gain strength, find courage. Like a newborn fawn, the opportunity for rapid development is there; yet it is only through determination that the fawn can rise to its feet and grow to full stature. Keep going despite difficulties and you will find the success that you desire.

A key challenge at this time is to maintain clarity. Avoid lunging at solutions. Do not start a new project or relationship before thinking it through. Make yourself wait until a good course of action becomes clear. A careless step in the beginning can cause events to get out of control later. And be sure to enlist the advice of experienced people and wise supporters.
