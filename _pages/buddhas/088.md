# Balance

## Be yourself today, turn off the dopamine addictions of social media and apps. Find balance in just being you. Find happiness in looking at flowers or watching a spider crawl across your bed in the morning.

## Meaning

He who stands on tiptoe is not steady.
He who strides cannot maintain the pace.
He who makes a show is not enlightened.
He who is self-righteous is not respected.
He who boasts achieves nothing.
He who brags will not endure.
According to followers of the Tao, "These are extra food and unnecessary luggage."
They do not bring happiness.
therefore followers of the Tao avoid them.
