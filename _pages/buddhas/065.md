# Eternal

## There is wisdom in not knowing

## Meaning

The buddhas ask you to reflect on what you actually know. It is important not to make assumptions in the world at this time. The truth is something that cannot be told but must be experienced.

The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao.
The name that can be named is not the eternal name.
The nameless is the beginning of heaven and Earth.
The named is the mother of the ten thousand things.
Ever desireless, one can see the mystery.
Ever desiring, one sees the manifestations.
These two spring from the same source but differ in name;
this appears as darkness.
Darkness within darkness.
The gate to all mystery.
