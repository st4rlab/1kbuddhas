# Mutual Influence

## Waiting patiently for more information and a clearer reason for acting will prevent misfortune.

## Meaning

The attraction of opposites is a powerful and fundamental force, especially that of a mutual attraction in the beginning stages. In response to the magnetic attraction between two people, the masculine principle (the creative and outgoing) seizes the initiative and then submits to the feminine (the receptive and nourishing). When the assertive is able to defer to the receptive, and when the receptive accepts responsibility and exercises its quiet leadership, an electric and profitable union is the result. This brings good fortune, for all success depends upon the effects of mutual attraction in some form or another.

Consistency is important in matters of mutual attraction, for this is what separates courtship from mere seduction.

If you are an initiator by nature, it is good to make the first move. But you must remain sensitive and highly principled to avoid the temptation to be at all manipulative. Let the power of mutual attraction pull you along. If you are the receptive one, keep your mind innocent and free of pride, so that you may remain open to good advice or helpful assistance. When your influence arises from innocence, a powerful magnetic force is at work for you.

Either way, remaining open to the forces of attraction brings good fortune, and closing yourself off to them shuts down the soul. Learn to yield to the tugs and pulls of the heart.
