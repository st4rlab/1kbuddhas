# Forward Motion

## Pushing ahead brings good fortune! With the support of those above and below, progress is unstoppable.



The situation is one of easy, natural progress. What has been weak is ascending, and by gaining a prominent position, will become more powerful. One image here is the light of the rising sun, which at first appears dimly through the mists. But this same light will radiate with powerful clarity once the sun has reached its high position in the sky.

Progress is made when those in supporting positions make peace with those in leadership, and in so doing, create a natural means for their talents and abilities to become more visible. It is by recognizing and riding with the natural course of events—by hitching our wagon to the rising sun, as it were—that we advance our position and earn respect.

Goodness in human nature is like the dim but beautiful early morning light. However, just as the morning light can be swallowed by the fog, greed, hatred, and other forms of self-absorption can obscure this goodness. Be reminded that progress is achieved most effortlessly when right action is taken without concern for immediate reward, and when the path of the weaker aligns with that which is strong.
