# The Light

## As seeds are planted, so shall they grow. Do not begin a new project without careful consideration.

## Meaning

Flames hang on to their fuel in order to keep the fire burning. Likewise, in the human world, everything that radiates light or love is dependent upon something else. Through the webs of our interdependence, we see that everything is related, each thing to the other. Awareness of your attachment to other people is the key that opens the door to knowing your true place in the world. No human is an island.

Fire is also a symbol of liberationâ€”crackling molecules that fly away from home. Paradoxically, by clinging to what is natural and appropriate, we gain inner freedom.

Given perseverance on your part, this reading indicates success. In spite of challenges, cling to what is luminous in yourself, in others, and in life itself, never forgetting your positive attachment to the highest good. When events seem foreboding, or people seem oppressive, remember the good that has been and is yet to be. Holding to this idea is to cling to the power of light, the only force that can illuminate darkness.
