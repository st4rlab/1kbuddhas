# Sacred Heart

## Purity of intent supports the manifestation of your dreams.



Affection is an important part of intimate relationships, but it must be handled carefully to be both satisfying and supportive of each person’s self-respect. For instance, a married person’s secret lover would have the conflicted feelings of affection coupled with insecurity. Relationships that are based on personal attraction—especially those that are unconventional—require special attention and a cautious measure of tactful reserve.

To overcome challenges and achieve longevity in a relationship, you need to remain mindful of extreme feelings of attraction as well as the transitory nature of most relationships. It is an irony of life that the happiest people are those who have what they want and who want what they have.

It is easy to make disastrous mistakes when you venture outside the bounds of propriety. If you assert yourself too much or try to make yourself indispensable, you will invite misfortune. If you are in doubt as to whether you should follow your heart or your head, allow some time to pass; and perhaps the answer will become clear. Boldly asserting yourself right now could bring misfortune, so do not attempt to be overly creative or to attract much favorable attention. At the same time, allowing yourself to drift aimlessly can be a mistake. Find balance in a middle way.
