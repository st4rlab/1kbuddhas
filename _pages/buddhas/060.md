# Restricting

## Before initiating any significant action, a wise person first evaluates their ability to successfully carry out the task.

## Meaning

Limits are necessary to channel energy, guide purpose, and lend direction to life. Constantly swimming in a sea of boundless opportunity leads to exhaustion. Winging it alone, wild and free in a sky of unlimited directions and opportunities, only leads to becoming lost. In human affairs, the making of decisions and alliances necessarily implies limitation, for in choosing one path, another must be left behind.

A key to a successful life is to select your limits consciously and carefully—to be discriminating in the setting of personal boundaries but also knowing when to fly in formation. Just as thrift often precedes prosperity, letting go of selfish interests leads to greater personal reward. Only by consciously accepting useful limits can your energy be channeled to good purpose and lead to lasting accomplishment.

Aim for a middle way between discipline and freedom of spirit. Limits will come of their own accord; but to consciously make good decisions and select compatible affiliations? Now that’s knowing how to fly! On the other hand, do not go overboard on discipline. Even limitation must be limited in the effort to bring order and direction into your life—to avoid choking off vital sources of enthusiasm and spontaneity.

In groups and organizations, rules and regulations should strike a balance between being too strict and too lenient. If these guidelines are too difficult to live with, frustration will build and ultimately become destructive. If the rules are too soft, sloppiness will become acceptable and energy will dissipate. The best path is one that allows for the unfolding of individual potential while encouraging self-discipline and focus along the way.
