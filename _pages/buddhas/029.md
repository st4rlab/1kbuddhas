## Focus on maintaining your balance as best you can

## Meaning

Exposure to danger brings good fortune to those who move beyond it. Like boaters staying afloat through white-water rapids, those faced with serious challenges need to remain alert. They must take all available precautions and, above all, keep going forward, so as to remove themselves from harmâ€™s way. Once the danger has passed, everything flows smoothly downstream.

The positive side of danger is that it offers an excellent chance to cleanse the senses and strengthen the spirit. Surviving a crisis can be tremendously reinvigorating, sharpening the eye and the mind for future challenges.

It is reckless to court danger but critical for inner development to not shrink from it either. Those who respond to dangerous conditions most effectively are those who can establish an inner bubble of calm in the midst of chaos. An emotionally stable center keeps one rooted in the moment, alert and focused. Courage at times like these springs from focused attention and a brave willingness to penetrate the moment of peril to its very core, to reshape and transform it.
