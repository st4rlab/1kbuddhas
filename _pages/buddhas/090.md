# Heart of Light

## Traveling at night with your eyes closed is recommended. Try it just for a few seconds and see how far you can go walking down the sidewalk. There is freedom in walking to listen or standing to feel. 



The heavy is the root of the light.
The still is the master of unrest.

Therefore the sage, traveling all day,
Does not lose sight of his baggage.
Though there are beautiful things to be seen,
He remains unattached and calm.

Why should the lord of ten thousand chariots act lightly in public?
To be light is to lose one's root.
To be restless is to lose one's control.
