# Honesty

## Inspired Buddha walks the mountain path with mindfulness allowing the feeling of inspiration to be present without attachment.



The 1000 Buddhas ask you to be honest with yourself and reveal your true innocence. Innocence implies a natural harmlessness, an openness, and pure intentions unsullied by ulterior motives. The condition of innocence has less to do with age than with attitude. Innocence springs from a heart that remains open to joy and wonder. Innocence, when guided by a firm faith in what is just and balanced, brings supreme success. Naivet√©, on the other hand, proceeds blindly, unanchored by the ability to discern right from wrong, and can bring misfortune.

The hallmark of Honesty is a willingness to treat all creatures with compassion and respect. Those who possess a pure heart are best guided by their instincts and intuition. Thinking too much severs links with the guidance of the heart. Be wary of courses of action that require too much cleverness.
