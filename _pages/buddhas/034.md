# Strength

## Inspired Buddha walks the mountain path with mindfulness allowing the feeling of inspiration to be present without attachment.

## Meaning

The Buddha asks you to be mindful in this moment and the coming days ahead. Allow the inspiration to flow through you without being attached to the outcomes. Inspiration is needed for you to overcome the challenges being presented to you and maybe also is an indicator of your creative potential at this moment. Think about what creativity means to you. There are many ways to be creative beyond the realms of art. You can be creative with your life, thinking about your life as a work in progress and what you can do to make it better. Another way is to be creative with your relationships. We can all use some time to think about how other people have helped us.

Inspiration is calling you at this time. Ask yourself what you can learn from this.
