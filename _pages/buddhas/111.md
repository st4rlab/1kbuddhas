# The Rainbow

## Treat your life as if you were dancing on a rainbow everyday. Be honest with yourself and reveal the full spectrum of who you are. Never deny your true self. Always look for connection and harmony without attachment to the outcomes.

## Meaning

Without going outside, you may know the whole world.
Without looking through the window, you may see the ways of heaven.
The farther you go, the less you know.

Thus the sage knows without traveling;
He sees without looking;
He works without doing.
