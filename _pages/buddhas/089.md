# Greatness

## There is no greater task in the world than climbing a mountain, only to go back down again, because the experience of greatness is temporary. Hold fast to kindness and share your success with others. Find someone that you can help. Know that your success means that someone else is failing and pay it forward to inspire those around you.

## Meaning

Something mysteriously formed,
Born before heaven and Earth.
In the silence and the void,
Standing alone and unchanging,
Ever present and in motion.
Perhaps it is the mother of ten thousand things.
I do not know its name
Call it Tao.
For lack of a better word, I call it great.

Being great, it flows
I flows far away.
Having gone far, it returns.

Therefore, "Tao is great;
Heaven is great;
Earth is great;
The king is also great."
These are the four great powers of the universe,
And the king is one of them.

Man follows Earth.
Earth follows heaven.
Heaven follows the Tao.
Tao follows what is natural.
