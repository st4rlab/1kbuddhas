# Strategy

## Pay close attention to everything you do, using the best of your experience to draw out even better outcomes in life.

## Meaning

Better to stop short than fill to the brim.
Oversharpen the blade, and the edge will soon blunt.
Amass a store of gold and jade, and no one can protect it.
Claim wealth and titles, and disaster will follow.
Retire when the work is done.
This is the way of heaven.
