# Turning Back

## Don’t move too fast, as a new momentum is just beginning.



A turning point recharges you and eventually brings success. This hexagram is associated with the turning of darkness back toward the light—the winter solstice, the shortest day of the year, the day when darkness begins to decrease and the hours of daylight start to increase. This is the cusp of a turnaround—a time for letting go of the old and making way for the new; a time of new beginnings. And it all starts with rest.

Don’t move too fast, as a new momentum is just beginning. This turnaround requires that your energy be recharged by adequate rest so that your life force is not depleted prematurely. This principle of hibernation—of allowing energy to renew itself and be strengthened by rest—applies to many situations: recuperation after an illness, the slow return of trust after a period of estrangement, the careful development of new relationships after the splitting apart of old ones.
