# Understanding

## Once in a while you get shown the light, in the strangest of places if you look at it right.



The softest thing in the universe
Overcomes the hardest thing in the universe.
That without substance can enter where there is no room.
Hence I know the value of non-action.

Teaching without words and work without doing
Are understood by very few.
