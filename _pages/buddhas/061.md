# Sincerity

## Inner preparation brings success.



Centering in truth involves becoming conscious of the relationship between your heart and the circumstances of your life. This requires connecting with the fundamental wisdom that is within you, within other people, and within all of nature.

Truth becomes power when you let go of prejudice and make yourself receptive to the world as it really is. This kind of inner transformation can produce a remarkably influential person, but it is difficult to achieve in the distracting modern world of false messages and fake friendships. It is achieved only by those who cultivate a genuine openness to the way things are and possess a willingness to see into the heart of things, rather than to merely looking at appearances.

When your inner life is clouded, your influence in the world is likewise hidden. If you are fearful, you will be attacked; if you cloak mysteries with dogma, opportunities for insight will be lost. If you waver in upholding your principles, you will be tested. Yet when you are firm and strong, the power of truth can break through even the most stubborn minds (including your own).

In a debate, the power to perceive the truth in anotherâ€™s position is essential to winning the contest. Generally, it is possible to influence even the most difficult people, or improve the most difficult circumstance, through the power of shedding light on universal truths; for truth is something to which all beings naturally respond. Get in touch with that part of yourself that is in touch with this power. Cultivate this ability and become adept at using it, as it will allow you to relate to those who might come to share a common purpose with you for the greater good.
