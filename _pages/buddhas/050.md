# Creation

## If you are virtuous as you nurture your unique talents, you will succeed.

## Meaning

The Creation reading symbolizes nourishment and rejuvenation. Sooner or later, good comes to those who do good; joy comes to those who bring joy to others; opportunity comes to those who persist in their dreams. Rejuvenation is a returning to one’s natural desires and the recharging of batteries that comes from making progress toward one’s aspirations. This reading suggests nourishment and transformation for people of goodwill. Good fortune and success are indicated here.

Healthy, regular sustenance is vitally important, as symbolized by the cooking pot, which provides nourishment to all. When the cycle of humanity reaches its apex, each person’s sustenance comes in the form of fulfilling his or her deepest needs and desires.

Rejuvenation means that people in honorable pursuit of their dreams are properly nourished and valued. When society is functioning properly, such people are supported and encouraged to contribute to their best abilities. A fresh approach to old habits is indicated. Look for ways of putting new life into old forms. Only when great vitality is present can real breakthroughs be achieved.
