# Household

## This is a time of reward and recognition. Remember that the leader has a responsibility to set a good example.

## Meaning

A family that thrives is one in which a healthy interdependence is cultivated. Respect for different roles is essential. A common example is between a wife and a husband, whose shared authority is critical; in fact, strong and harmonious kinship is dependent upon every member of the family or tribe. Trust, shared responsibilities, and good communication are primary values. Each person must be encouraged to find his or her position and appropriate contribution.

A harmonious family is a team that symbolizes the ideal of human interdependence, and has long provided a foundation for society. The healthy family is an embryo of community and the native soil in which ethical values take root and grow. Fertilize this soil, and the entire society benefits.

The forces that bind a family are a balance of feminine and masculine—the nurturing and receptive combined with outgoing leadership and taking responsibility. In other words, good parenting. A parent’s words should be consistent, and have meaning and power. Siblings’ relationships between themselves and their parents carry variations of feminine and masculine energies too. Relations on all kinds of teams are improved through cultivation of a yin/yang, open/focused balance. Learn to listen to and receive help from others, and be willing to assume an appropriate role in any group you belong to. A good team player is supremely valuable to everyone.
