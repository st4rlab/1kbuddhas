# Delight

## Having seen a flower for the first time, a child dances in pure bliss.

## Meaning

Delight unleashes enormous creative energy. The effect is like powerful music that inspires great numbers of people, loosening constraints and sprouting new opportunities. The power of enthusiasm is best symbolized by music and dance. It is guided more by the heart than the head. Good fortune can follow when an enthusiastic leader is a person of strong character—one who is able to guide this positive energy toward a favorable destination.

Delight or enthusiasm, in a personal relationship or in a group, generates special electricity. For instance, when the crowd at a music festival is charged up, the singers scale new heights; and life—the shared experience of the moment—becomes its own reward. And who is not in awe of thunder? Who would fail to fill his or her lungs with refreshing air in the aftermath of a cleansing rain?

Arouse the passionate support of others while adjusting your ideas and plans to suit their needs. In this way, you can fill your sails with the mighty wind of popular support.

To arouse others, redouble your dedication, and dare to create an environment that is free of tension. Take joy in your work. Harness the power of song and dance in your own way.
