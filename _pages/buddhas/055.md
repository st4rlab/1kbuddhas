# Abundance

## To facilitate an experience of abundance, bring a mixture of energy and vision. 

## Meaning

Abundance comes into full flower when a group is unified and the power of its leadership is at its peak. This is like the sun at midday—a high noon of clarity, insight, and progress. Whether this refers to a national cycle, a business boon, or a period of personal abundance, peak periods can be brief; so it is important to bale your hay while the sun is shining.

During a period of abundance, it is skillful to show benevolence and to share the fruits of one’s good fortune. Think of good deeds now as a hedge against scarcity in the future. This reading bodes well for the raising of children and the nurturing of a healthy family, or any close-knit group.
