# Hindrance

## A stream is not angered by a rock in it's way, it simply moves around it in perfect grace.

## Meaning

In periods of standstill or stagnation, confusion and disorder can prevail. Small-minded and self-serving forces arise when the powers of clarity and creativity are on the decline; the inmates are overrunning the prison and its guards. In such times, summon up your fortitude, donâ€™t shine your light, simply withdraw. The wise take shelter in their own integrity and quietly remain faithful to their principles. Retreat from public activities and common exchanges until the times favor direct action. Concentrate on personal affairs with a humble dignity, even if that means letting go of some short-term rewards.

Desiring to change such a situation too quickly creates extra conflict. By accepting some hardship, while striving to maintain integrity, you are preparing for future growth. Remember that a seed of prosperity is often hidden inside the husk of misfortune.
