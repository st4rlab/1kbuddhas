# Small Influences

## Inspired Buddha walks the mountain path with mindfulness allowing the feeling of inspiration to be present without attachment.



A gentle wind gathers clouds, but still, there is no rain. Softer influences predominate as the power of smaller forces accumulates, making this a time for smooth and friendly persuasion.

The ebb and flow of events are like waves in the sea, and there are periods of low tide. At present, more sweeping actions are impossible or inappropriate, but small matters ultimately lead to bigger and better things when attended to with success. When the tide is rolling in, by all means ride the waves; when they are receding like they are now, however, focus on the little things.

When you cannot do much to affect large matters, persuasion and subtle influence prepare the way for stronger moves in the future. Use your intuition to chart your long-term course, but avoid bold actions—they are unlikely to work. This is a better time to refine existing abilities or develop new talents.

Gentleness is the key word here. Regarding whatever is on your mind right now, gentleness—combined with determination—is likely to generate more progress than brute force ever could.
