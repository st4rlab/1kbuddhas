# Developing Gradually

## When situations are allowed to develop gradually, in due time, liabilities evolve into assets.

## Meaning

Like an ancient forest—where the subtle play of light, texture, and shadow results from a process measured in centuries and inches—things of lasting value develop gradually, at their own pace. The ability to learn from experience—one of humanity’s greatest treasures—implies constant yet gradual progress. The combination of stillness within and determination without are the essence of this process. Good things can sprout quickly, but the truly delightful take much longer, like a beautiful tree on a mountainside.

The principle of gradual development also applies to relationships. For love, marriage, and other long-term partnerships, the best progress is slow but steady—slow enough to allow for bonds to knit properly and steady enough to keep moving in the right direction. A firmly rooted tree has deep roots and is not easily toppled. Steady development of your depths is what makes sustainable, long-term progress possible.

You can’t expect to have everything all at once. Development must be free to run its course; events must be allowed to unfold in their own natural time—neither rushed nor manipulated. In this way, you will achieve and enjoy long-lasting relationships, as well as success in the world.
