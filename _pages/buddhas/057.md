# Mindfulness

## When negative forces are undermining your best plans, trace the shadows back to their source and gently expose them to the light. 



A subtle penetrating effect is like a soft wind blowing through reeds that are bending gracefully, demonstrating flexibility and endurance. This symbolizes a quiet, relaxed effectiveness in action. A gentle influence is at work; but just as the wind can be ceaseless in its efforts, small forces can add up to produce lasting results.

Gentle penetration bodes well for new relationships or enterprises. Just as a summer breeze slowly penetrates the woods to cool the forest, the ideas of gifted leaders slowly reach and sink into the minds and hearts of people. In personal relationships, a gentle beginning can lead to a long-lasting union.

When using a force that is soft but persistent, careful aim is necessary; for only when a small force continually moves in the same direction will it have a cumulative effect. In human affairs, this kind of soft influence comes more through strength of character than by direct confrontation or active seduction. It’s important to have—and stick to—clearly defined goals. Maintaining a strong vision and following a steady course of least resistance will bring good fortune.
