# Diversity

## It may seem at times that the universe is conspiring against you, but when opposition to progress is at its peak, an opening soon emerges.

## Meaning

Some level of estrangement is indicated. For example, when brothers and sisters choose partners and marry, they often grow apart, since their allegiances prioritize new families. Though they will remain close enough to deal with problems and interests related to their original family, they are less likely to undertake great projects together. Simply put, when people grow apart—even for the most natural of reasons—their points of view, values, interests and schedules diverge.

Different natures and interests bring opposition into the world of human affairs. If opposition drifts into alienation and enmity, good results are few (if at all). But when opposition takes the form of healthy competition, or when it is recognized as part of the natural order of things, good fortune is still possible for the relationship.

When diverging interests make a situation seem stagnant or futile, remember that there are always creative possibilities inherent in polarities. One is reminded of the interplay of the opposites, yin and yang, which is fundamental to life itself. As the symbol of the Tao illustrates, the yin and the yang each have the seed of the other residing within them.

If opposition has its roots in issues of principle, you must hold on to your integrity and individuality. Let go of vulgar or self-absorbed people who do not share your values. With both people and companies, one measure of stature is the quality of one’s competition.
