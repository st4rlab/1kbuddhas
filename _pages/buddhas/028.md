# Exceeding

## The wise take great care, especially in the beginning.



Something is about to collapse. A great pressure is causing an imbalance that needs correction. If the dam is about to burst, moving out of the way is your first priority! Likewise, if you are in an old mine shaft and feel the earth begin to tremble, it is a time for quick, instinctive action and nimble footwork—only extraordinary measures can produce a successful outcome. When the roof is collapsing, run first, and choose your destination later.

Extraordinary times bring out the best and worst in people. Natural disasters produce stories of heroism but also of looting and rioting. When a great weight is upon your world, powerful moments present opportunities to make great gains, because everything is in a state of flux. One can either move in the direction of positive change and improvement or toward stagnation. To achieve the former, one must go gently to the heart of the issue—to the cause. Then a smooth transition is assured.

This may be the moment you have been waiting for. Although the current challenge may seem to be more than you can handle, remember that a flood usually reaches its high-water mark for only a few brief moments before it begins to subside. Action must be taken now to ensure opportunities for success later on. You never know the true extent of your abilities until you, at least once in your life, dive into a crisis with complete abandon, dedicating every ounce of your energy and every fiber of your being to the cause at hand. Now is that time. Dare to win.
